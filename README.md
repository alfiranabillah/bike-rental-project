# Bike Rental Analysis
This is a final project from Dicoding in the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course to make analysis and create a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. See the detail of this analysis and visualization on the [notebook](dashboard/app.py) In the notebook file, I attached the way I did the analysis from Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. 

## Project Work Cycle
### 1. Data Wrangling:
* Gathering data
* Assessing data
* Cleaning data
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Create data exploration
### 3. Data Visualization:
* Create data visualization to answer business question
### 4. Dashboard:
* Set up the DataFrame which will be used
* Make filter components on the dashboard
* Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations
